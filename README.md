# Autobalancing Binary Search Tree Header library
# Intro
This library was written with the purpose of creating an autobalancing binary search tree datastructure. My original intent was to just practice and refresh myself with data structures. I encourage the use and distribution of this library. Feel free to use the library in your personal projects and work.
